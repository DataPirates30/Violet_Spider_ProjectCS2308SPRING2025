# Violet_Spider_ProjectCS2308 -Spring2025

## Overview

In the **Overview** section, briefly summarize the project’s **objective**, core **functionalities**, and key **outcomes**. Highlight the **main goal** (e.g., developing a Sudoku solver), major **challenges** faced, and the strategies or algorithms used to overcome them. Mention any notable **technical achievements(Learned to use git/github)**, such as optimizations or different modes (**DEBUG**/**non-DEBUG**).

In the next paragraph, reflect on the **skills** and **knowledge** gained, like improvements in **problem-solving**, **code optimization**, or **collaboration**. If applicable, mention how the team worked together and how the project contributed to your overall learning experience.

## Part 1: Complete the Code

## Part 2: Program Flow Visualization

**Flowchart for Sudoku Solver Execution (Non-DEBUG Mode):**

```text
main()
│
├── xxxx
│   └── xxxxx
│       └── yyyy
```

This flow illustrates the general steps the program takes in non-DEBUG mode, from initializing the puzzle to saving the solved result.

## Part 3: Reflective Questions

1. **Group Photo:**

   *(Insert group photo here)*


2. **What contributions did your friends make? List them.**

    - **[Teammate 1]:** ...
    - **[Teammate 2]:** ...
    - **[Teammate 3]:** ...

3. **Why do you think `efficientSolver` took more time than the regular solver? What strategies would you implement to make `efficientSolver` actually efficient?**

   ...

4. **Can you make this a generalized solution, meaning board that can solve any NxN grid where N is a square number? Can you briefly share your ideas?**

   ...

5. **Did this project challenge and motivate you? We would appreciate your feedback on your experience. Feel free to share what you learned, what aspects of the project you found most engaging or challenging, and any suggestions you have for improving future projects. Your insights are valuable in helping us enhance future learning experiences.**

## Closing Thoughts

... The best method to debug is to use the "cout" or print statement. Throughout this project, we understand the power of print statement. It helps a lot to debug your program.
